BUILDING language-pack.nsi
--------------------------

- Builds to win_installer\build
- Language files are lacked up on installation at: 
  [LAMSDIR]\jboss-4.0.2\server\default\deploy\lams.ear\lams-dictionary.jar\backup

STEPS TO BUILD
--------------

1) Make sure you have all the latest language files in your lams workspace, you
   can do this by simply synchronising and updating with the CVS repository
2) Put the date that you want for the install at this line (around line 35):
   !define VERSION "2006-20-12" (example)
   Make sure it is in the form "yyyy-mm-dd"
3) In updateLocales.sql, you must alter it to insert the required rows in the 
   database. Update updateLocales.sql, so that every language to be supported by
   the current version is in the list
   An example line is below:
   INSERT INTO locale_temp (language_iso_code, country_iso_code, description, direction, combined) VALUES ('pt','BR','Português (Brasil)','LTR','pt,BR');
4) In updateLocales.sql change the date to the date of this language pack at the line
   UPDATE lams_configuration set DictionaryDateCreated("2006-12-20"); (example)   
5) Compile language-pack.nsi
6) Run win_installer\build\LAMSLanguagePack-[DATE]
