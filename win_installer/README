Notes
1. The build.xml doesn't completely compile the installer, but only does some 
   helper tasks (TODO)
2. NSIS plugin for Eclipse: http://eclipsensis.sourceforge.net (you still need 
   to install the NSIS compiler)

Steps to build installer
0. Build LAMS as usual.  Make sure you have also checked out jsMath (needed for
   step 4).  
   If using an alternate location for JBOSS_HOME and LAMS_CONF, specify these at
   the top of src/installer.nsi.
1. Run the dump-db and compile-java targets in the main build.xml file
2. Make sure the dump.sql in build/ is encoded in UTF-8 (I haven't tested what 
   happens if it isn't, but just in case)
3. Compile src/lams-start.nsi and src/lams-stop.nsi
4. Compile src/installer.nsi.
