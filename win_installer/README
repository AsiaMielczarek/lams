Notes
1. The build.xml doesn't completely compile the installer, but only does some 
   helper tasks (TODO)
2. NSIS plugin for Eclipse: http://eclipsensis.sourceforge.net (you still need 
   to install the NSIS compiler)

Steps to build installer
1. Build LAMS as usual.  If using an alternate location for JBOSS_HOME, specify 
   at the top of src/installer.nsi
2. Check out jsMath and run the build-war ant target (needed for
   step 6)
3. Start LAMS, login as sysadmin/sysadmin, and delete the users 'test', 'mmm'
   and 'lamskh01'.
4. Run the dump-db and compile-java targets in the main build.xml file
5. Compile src/lams-start.nsi and src/lams-stop.nsi
6. Compile src/installer.nsi.
