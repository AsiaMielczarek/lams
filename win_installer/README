Notes
1. The build.xml doesn't completely compile the installer, but only does some 
   helper tasks (TODO)
2. NSIS plugin for Eclipse: http://eclipsensis.sourceforge.net (you still need 
   to install the NSIS compiler)

Steps to build installer
1. Build LAMS as usual.  If using an alternate location for JBOSS_HOME and 
   LAMS_CONF, specify these at the top of src/installer.nsi.
2. Check out jsMath and run the build-war ant target (needed for
   step 5).  
3. Run the dump-db and compile-java targets in the main build.xml file
4. Compile src/lams-start.nsi and src/lams-stop.nsi
5. Compile src/installer.nsi.
