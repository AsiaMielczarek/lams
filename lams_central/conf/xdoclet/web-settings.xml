<!--
	In LAMS 2.3 there was a change in this section in all tools and core parts (central, learning, monitoring etc.)
	All LAMS web application now use shared application context. See refBeanContext.xml file in lams_common for its description.
	This refBeanContext.xml contains definition of the shared context. It is located by this entry:
	<context-param>
   		<param-name>locatorFactorySelector</param-name>
   		<param-value>classpath:/org/lamsfoundation/lams/beanRefContext.xml</param-value>
	</context-param>
	telling to look for refBeanContext.xml files in selected part of the classpath.
	Currently LAMS has only one refBeanContext.xml with one shared context definition.
	
	Lams_central uses only beans from the shared context "context.central". That is why there is no value
	in contextConfigLocation.
	Even so, this parameter needs to be declared with empty value for locatorFactorySelector to work properly.
	Also, if no local application context file is declare, there MUST be a file named "applicationContext.xml"
	in web/WEB-INF containing empty bean list, otherwise there will be errors during start up.
	If there are local (private for web application; see tools and admin for example) bean definitions,
	path to application context XML file can still be added to contextConfigLocation.

 	contextClass parameter may be removed later in the development, as it does not solve Ant-style pattern problem
