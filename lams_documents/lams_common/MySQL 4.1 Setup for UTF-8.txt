# =============
# Windows version
# =============
* Windows version of MySQL 4.1 now comes with 3 installation packages.

* If you used Windows-installer versions, they ask about the language setting.
  Choose the "most internatioanl" option, which uses UTF-8.
  
* You should use the standard installation version
  (not the "essentail" version) for development, since
  it installs the bebug codes in case you need it.

* Then, create the lams database as the Chris' instruction below.

* my.ini or my.conf used to be located in C:\
  but now it is located where your copy of MySQL is installed
  (typically C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 4.1).
  This allows different instances of MySQL to run with
  config files of their own, if you have not installed it
  as a Service (which you should not for a development environment).
  Add the line in the my.ini as Chris' instruction to 
  change the default transaction isolation level.

# =============
# Linux/Solaris version
# =============
* my.conf file is located at /etc/my.conf
* If it does not exist, you have to create one by
* copying a sample config file included in the MySQL
  home directory

# =============
# Securing the initial database
# =============
* Set the root password as:
  mysqladmin -u root password "yoursecret"

* As usual, delete the "test" database which has the anonymous user
  drop database test;
  
* Also, delete the anonymous user (user=' ' and password is ' ');
  delete from user where user=' ';

Firstly in order to cope with UTF-8 character sets we must use MySQL 4.1.
To achieve this:

    1) lams db must be created to use UTF-8

    CREATE DATABASE lams DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8;

    2) JDBC connection must be told to use UTF-8

    jdbc:mysql://137.111.229.13:3306/lams?characterEncoding=utf8


Secondly the transaction isolation level for InnoDB should be set to
READ-COMMITTED: this seems to occur out of the box for Win32 
(which is good because there doesn't seem to be a way of altering it
that works on 4.1 in Windows) but the linux version 
(and I am assumeing other UNIX-like OSs) defaults to REPEATABLE-READ.
In order to change this for linux you need to create or edit the 
config file /etc/my.cnf like the following:

[mysqld]
transaction-isolation=READ-COMMITTED


Note that according to the documentation you should be able to change the system variables to achieve these changes (or at least make changes that produce the same results) using the SET GLOBAL <variable>=<value> commands like we do in MySQL 4.0. Unfortunately the SET GLOBAL does not seem to work for many of the system variables 4.1 (though it doesn't produce an error).
