cache.entries.title=Cache Nodes
cache.explanation1=Listed below are the current nodes in the cache. This keeps certain common objects in memory to speed up LAMS. It is managed automatically and should not require any intervention. However, if the system appears to be keeping "old values" e.g. an old first name, try clearing all the nodes in the cache. Once cleared, LAMS will reload the objects from the database. 
cache.explanation2=Warning: Removing nodes will reduce the performance of the LAMS server. After a while, the cache will build up again and LAMS will run as usual.   
cache.explanation3=Warning: If you remove a node, you will remove the node and all its child nodes. 
cache.button.remove=Remove
