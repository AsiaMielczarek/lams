Subject: LAMS 1.1 Database Configuration

Firstly in order to cope with UTF-8 character sets we must use MySQL 4.1.
To achieve this:

    1) lams db must be created to use UTF-8

    CREATE DATABASE lams DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8;

    2) JDBC connection must be told to use UTF-8

    jdbc:mysql://137.111.229.13:3306/lams?characterEncoding=utf8


Secondly the transaction isolation level for InnoDB should be set to
READ-COMMITTED: this seems to occur out of the box for Win32 (which is good because there doesn't seem to be a way of altering it that works on
4.1 in Windows) but the linux version (and I am assumeing other UNIX-like OSs) defaults to REPEATABLE-READ.  In order to change this for linux you need to create or edit the config file /etc/my.cnf like the
following:

[mysqld]
transaction-isolation=READ-COMMITTED


Note that according to the documentation you should be able to change the system variables to achieve these changes (or at least make changes that produce the same results) using the SET GLOBAL <variable>=<value> commands like we do in MySQL 4.0. Unfortunately the SET GLOBAL does not seem to work for many of the system variables 4.1 (though it doesn't produce an error).
