To download packaged versions of the lamstwo module for different versions of
Moodle, go to http://wiki.lamsfoundation.org/display/lams/Downloads#Downloads-moodle.


Layout
------
Previously this project only contained the lamstwo module (lamstwo module folder and
lamstwo.php language file).  With the addition of tool adapter functionality,
and its accompanying Moodle source changes, the lamstwo module is now
located in moodle/mod/lamstwo, and the language file in 
moodle/lang/en_utf8/lamstwo.php.


For those interested in the lamstwo module:
-------------------------------------------
Export the lamstwo module:
1. export moodle/mod/lamstwo folder
2. export moodle/lang/en_utf8/lamstwo.php
3. copy to the equivalent folders in your moodle installation.

See http://wiki.lamsfoundation.org/display/lamsdocs/Moodle for setup info.
