If you need to reset LAMS, you should be able to run this script but take into account that this WILL WIPE OUT ALL THE EXISTING INFORMATION!!

If you want to change any db settings, modify the db.properties file accodingly. 


   /usr/local/lams/ant/bin/ant -v -logfile database.log insert-data

If you have questions or comments: http://lamscommunity.org
